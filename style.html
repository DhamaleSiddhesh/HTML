            A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. 
            This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry 
            materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer 
            of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread 
            out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. 
            Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear 
            leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the
             food for the tree's growth and development.</p>
